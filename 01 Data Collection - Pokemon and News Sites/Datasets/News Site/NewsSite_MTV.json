The contests-filled evening featured the crew playing \"Who's the most...\" and the most spoiled, can't keep a secret and biggest drama queen  Aimee taking a bunch of shots.Then the group unanimously decided that Gus was the most insecure, while Jeremiah was chosen as the most entitled.\"Surprise, surprise! I'd like to know exactly why I'm the most entitled. Please!\" Jeremiah pleaded.Codi offered up a definition of entitled (\"someone who thinks they are better than everybody else in the f*cking room\"), while Gus chimed in that \"sometimes you gotta own it, man.\" Kirk's effort to give an example of how Jeremiah can act this way -- like insisting \"I'm not doing this\" to everyone -- infuriated Jeremiah even more.\"Gus hasn't done the same thing?!\" an incredulous Jeremiah spat.\"No, f*ck that! I can honestly say I've never done that,\" Gus yelled back. Jeremiah's \"sideways look\" at Gus and Gus demanding Jeremiah to \"name one instance\" only fanned the flames -- and prompted Gus to stand up.

Growing up in Los Angeles with a parent in the entertainment industry, she was always surrounded by a diverse, eclectic cast of characters, and her inquisitive nature meant she had a desire to learn about each of them and share their stories. Today the 19-year-old screenwriter is doing just that with Genera+ion, the queer coming-of-age dramedy she crafted while still in high school.With all the stylistic edge of Euphoria and the biting relatability of Degrassi, Genera+ion\u00a0homes in on the darkness and beauty of being a teenager today. It follows a loosely connected crew of high schoolers as they navigate everything from sexuality and gender identity, to substance use and social media, to all the hyped-up horniness you\u2019d expect from the genre. The first episode introduces Chester (Justice Smith), a gay boy with a provocative fashion sense; Greta (Haley Sanchez), an introverted lesbian; and Nathan, a bisexual boy coming to terms with his sexuality.https://www.instagram.com/p/CMIGLXVpOTk/While LGBTQ+ characters have often been relegated to stereotypical sidekick roles, or limited to coming-out narratives, Zelda places them at the forefront; and while grappling with their queerness is indeed an important struggle, it by no means defines them. Each high schooler faces different challenges in their day-to-day lives. Chester lives with his grandmother after his mom dies from cancer. Greta moves in with her aunt after her mother is deported. Nathan struggles with breaking away from his twin sister Naomi (Chloe East) and creating an identity of his own.\u201cWe really tried to focus on queer representation and making sure that when watching our show, queer kids felt really seen,\u201d Zelda says. \u201cAll of our queer characters, their personalities are not just about being queer. They have so much more to them than just their sexualities.\u201dWhen we first meet Nathan, he is curious about Chester. He also struggles to keep his sexuality a secret from Naomi, which proves more difficult after he hooks up with her boyfriend at a party. Zelda was inspired to create Nathan due to a lack of male bisexual characters in film and television. \u201cI think bi men are ignored and often told, \u2018It\u2019s just a phase. This is just a stepping stone on the road to coming out as gay,\u2019 which just isn't true,\u201d Zelda says. \u201cAlso bi women are often fetishized instead of represented simply as bi women. I definitely think it's very important to have a bi, male character who is just bisexual. And that's there's nothing else complicated with his sexuality.\u201dhttps://youtu.be/LaW_mdEqwpgZelda, herself, is bisexual. She came out to her parents, Daniel and Ben Barnz at age 15, during a three-week stint at summer camp. The camp\u2019s rules forbade Zelda from using her phone, so she wrote a letter. \u201cI ended with \u2018I'm bisexual. Love, Zelda.\u2019 And they wrote back,\u201d Zelda says. \u201cIt was not difficult for me, having gay parents, to come out, which I also feel so incredibly lucky for.\u201d While Genera+ion is set within a conservative community, Zelda says she never felt like an outsider.\u201cGrowing up in Los Angeles, there are a lot of kids who have gay parents,\u201d Zelda adds. \u201cThat was really interesting meeting kids who were adopted like me, or who had gay parents like me. I feel so incredibly lucky to grow up in a space where I never felt like I was the only adopted kid in my class or the only kid with gay parents in my class.\u201dOther aspects of the series are ripped straight from her life, as in the second episode, when Nathan, Greta, and Chester visit their school\u2019s Gay-Straight Alliance club. As a teenager, Zelda was involved in a group at her school called Rainbow Alliance, where she formed friendships with other LGBTQ+ students. Zelda would share stories about Rainbow Alliance meetings with her fathers, who encouraged her to write them down. \u201cThese stories were really funny and poignant,\u201d Daniel Barnz says. \u201cSometimes it was sort of about this person\u2019s struggle, but sometimes it was like, this person showed up at the club meeting, and they were just looking for a date. And [these stories] made me laugh.\u201dWarrick Page / HBO MaxZelda originally planned to write Genera+ion as a novel or a series of short stories based on those Rainbow Alliance meetings, though she dreamed that one day they would be adapted for the screen. But Daniel, who wrote films like Won\u2019t Back Down and Beastly, encouraged Zelda to write it as a TV show from the beginning. He taught Zelda how to write scripts, and the two bonded over creating the Genera+ion universe.\u201cI will admit, there was a bit of craven, selfish desire [in creating a television show] because I thought if she was game to do it with me, what an amazing opportunity to do something creative with my daughter,\u201d Daniel says. In his first stab at the teen genre, he serves as co-creator and executive producer. \u201cAnd also to show her a little bit about the work that I do.\u201d Given the generational gap, the father-daughter duo kept each other in check about queer issues to depict on screen and how to portray them realistically. Daniel says Zelda occasionally tells him \u201cthat\u2019s not right\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t think that would really happen,\u201d so he offers her a listening ear.Zelda was 17 at the time she first pitched Genera+ion to HBO, and although she admits the initial meeting was rather daunting, she decided she was simply going to have fun and go in with an easy-going attitude. \u201cI remember walking into this huge conference room with this massive, long table,\u201d Zelda says. \u201cMy dad and I stood on one side pitching and all these like HBO executives and Lena Dunham were on the other side watching. And I did not think that it was going to get bought or made. So I was just like, \u2018I'm gonna have fun with it. I'm just going to do the best I can.\u2019\u201dJennifer Clasen / HBO MaxThe show was given a full-season order, with Dunham serving as an executive producer. When casting for the show, Zelda and Daniel wanted to find actors with a youthful style. \u201cWe really wanted to make sure that these kids looked young and felt young, and that they didn't look like 30-year-old models playing teenagers,\u201d Zelda says. \u201cThat was definitely a very helpful guideline to have when we were casting, and our cast is just beyond incredible.\u201dZelda\u2019s stories and consciousness of contemporary issues have manifested into one of this year\u2019s most hotly anticipated shows. With a gritty yet humorous tone, Genera+ion brings a no-holds-barred approach to depicting the lives and struggles of teens today. Daniel believes that parents can benefit from watching Genera+ion, noting that it would help facilitate open and honest conversations between parents and their children.\u201cSometimes there can be a dismissiveness about kids, which is so unfair,\u201d Daniel says. \u201cAnd it's something I've had to think about myself as a parent. And I feel like if parents can embrace that desire to look at their kids honestly and fairly, it would be amazing. I also think that, one of the reasons this show has been such a joy to work on is because Zelda and I have been able to communicate and talk honestly.\u201d ", "author": "MTV News Staff"}, {"date": "2021-03-11T19:00:32Z", "title": "Grab The Popcorn!

For women, owning one's work, body, and artistry can be especially powerful, even political. Throughout Women's History Month, MTV News is highlighting some of these iconic statements from some of the biggest artists on the globe. This is Self-Titled.In 2000, while filming scenes in the title role for Queen of the Damned in Australia, Aaliyah finished recording her third album. It had been in the works for a couple years \u2014 she reportedly completed most of it in New York before making her on-screen debut in that year\u2019s Romeo Must Die and releasing \u201cTry Again\u201d as the soundtrack\u2019s lead single. But despite the time gap, Aaliyah\u2019s vision for her eponymous album remained clear: to expand the boundaries of her sound.\u201cShe told me specifically what kind of records she wanted,\u201d singer-songwriter Tank, who wrote \u201cI Can Be\u201d and \u201cWhat If\u201d for Aaliyah, told the music blog YouKnowIGotSoul in 2011. \u201cShe kind of wanted a little dangerous, a little sexy, that type of thing.\u201dTank, with other co-writers and producers for the album including Static Major, Bud\u2019da, J.Dub, Key Beats, and Playa, hunkered down in Melbourne\u2019s Sing Sing Studios for about a month. Aaliyah, who filmed her scenes as the evil vampire Queen Akasha during the day, joined them in the evenings. When the album was released on July 7, 2001, it debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. It received rave reviews: Vibe called it \u201cthe best soul album of the young millennium,\u201d while Spin described Aaliyah as a \u201cmusicologist\u201d who creates \u201cmeaning outside the lyrics.\u201dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5AAcgtMjUIAaliyah was a continuation of the remarkable way the artist\u00a0 surpassed herself with each release. While 1994\u2019s Age Ain\u2019t Nothing but a Number bridged her precocious mystique with new jack swing, 1996\u2019s One in a Million highlighted Aaliyah\u2019s hushed tones with thumping, stuttering rhythms in collaboration with creative soul mates Missy Elliott and Timbaland. Aaliyah took all that and fused it into a sophisticated soundscape at the bleeding edge of sonic innovation.Aaliyah\u2019s forward-thinking musical outlook was representative of the enterprising artist she was \u2014 and the icon she so quickly became. As she developed her wide-ranging talent, her magnetic appeal flooded into other arenas: film, where she was cultivating a promising career, and fashion, where her laid-back, sensual style made her a muse for designers like Tommy Hilfiger. He even\u00a0launched a whole campaign around her wearing baggy jeans with an exposed waistband and bandeau top, the success of which inspired the brand\u2019s women\u2019s line. Importantly, Aaliyah was an inspiration for kids coming of age everywhere who saw glimpses of themselves in her.Considering the ingenuity of Aaliyah, it\u2019s no wonder. The production was mind-bending, characterized by a cybernated sonic freakiness, and the way Aaliyah pulled humanity out of digitized ones and zeroes is a master class in nuance. \u201cWe were trying to do as much as we could and try to put an album together for her to be able to hear and see what she felt,\u201d Bud\u2019da recalled.Aaliyah\u2019s honeyed falsetto was more robust and urgent than ever as she explored relationship dynamics and intimacy in Timbaland\u2019s twitchy syncopation (\u201cWe Need a Resolution,\u201d \u201cMore Than a Woman\u201d), desire in shimmering synthesizers (\u201cRock the Boat\u201d), liberation in swelling staccato (\u201cI Refuse\u201d), and jealousy in glitchy, industrial chaos (\u201cWhat If\u201d).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NLUthL6-BU\u201cThere are a lot of great flavors on the album,\u201d Aaliyah said in an interview with the Orlando Sentinel. \u201cIt's older, it's edgy, it's raw, yet it's a little bit of fun. I want to tell people where I am as a person in my life today.\u201dWhen Aaliyah was released, nothing sounded quite like it. TLC and Destiny\u2019s Child had played with staticky accents on Fanmail and The Writing\u2019s on the Wall, respectively \u2014 a trend that Aaliyah herself spurred with One in a Million \u2014 but Aaliyah was avant-garde. Weirder, in an electrifying kind of way; as Vibe described: \u201cdamn near post-R&B.\u201dIt\u2019s still impossible to fathom what happened next. Just a month after Aaliyah was released, returning home from the Bahamas where she shot the music video for \u201cRock the Boat,\u201d Aaliyah and eight other passengers lost their lives in a plane crash. She was only 22. The indelible mark she made on contemporary R&B and pop culture, at large, in such a short period of time had been so immediate: Aaliyah stretched the bounds of what R&B could sound like in a way that redefined the genre, while helping inform sonic trends of the early 2000s. Twenty years after the release of the album as well as her tragic death, the force of that impact still reverberates.It\u2019s not difficult to hear the direct influence Aaliyah made on the generation that followed her. Artists like Kehlani, Tinashe, Ciara, and Rihanna have taken audible cues from Aaliyah\u2019s soft vocal phrasing and left-of-center song qualities. \"We owe our chill vibe to her,\" Tinashe told Billboard. \"People were used to artists belting things out. She brought a new vocal styling that wasn\u2019t represented in R&B. Not everything has to be so uptempo.\" Drake is one of Aaliyah\u2019s loudest devotees, sampling her music (\u201cUnforgettable\u201d), referencing her in lyrics (\u201cBedRock\u201d), and rapping to her previously unreleased tracks (\u201cEnough Said\u201d). FKA Twigs channeled Aaliyah outright in \u201cTwo Weeks,\u201d pairing her sweet tone against anxious percussion and then paying music video homage to Queen of the Damned in full Queen Akasha regalia.\u201cThe new generation pulls inspiration from Aaliyah, despite not growing up with her, because she was authentic,\" Missy Elliott said in 2014. \"Her music couldn\u2019t be placed in a category.\"KMazur/WireImageIndeed, perhaps the best indicator of Aaliyah\u2019s influence is how it has extended into more unexpected musical territories like dubstep \u2014 which, bearing in mind the experimental nature of her work, isn\u2019t all that surprising. On \u201cIn McDonalds,\u201d electronic maestro Burial pitch-shifted Aaliyah\u2019s \u201cI Refuse\u201d into a whispering siren that cut through enigmatic sparsity. James Blake sampled \u201cAre You That Somebody?\u201d to form the foundation of his airy post-dubstep anthem \u201cCMYK.\u201dSuch a sweeping compass is one reason why Aaliyah\u2019s lack of visibility on streaming platforms feels so glaring. The majority of her catalog isn\u2019t available on any service. Aaliyah and One in a Million can be found on YouTube; there are bootlegs floating around the internet and random songs on Spotify featured on obscure compilations like R&B Divas and Girls of Hip Hop, Vol. 1. The only Aaliyah album currently available to stream is her first, Age Ain\u2019t Nothing but a Number, which was written and produced by R. Kelly; in 2019, Kelly faced charges of bribing an Illinois official in order to procure a fake ID for the then-15-year-old Aaliyah in order to marry her. He is currently imprisoned awaiting a trail on charges of racketeering and child pornography.Journalist Stephen Witt traces the streaming obstacle back to Aaliyah\u2019s uncle, Barry Hankerson, who owns most of her discography through his now-defunct Blackground Records imprint and who seems unwilling to release it. There are also issues with the fact that her three albums were each distributed through different labels.But with streaming as today\u2019s primary avenue of musical consumption, if Aaliyah\u2019s music isn\u2019t accessible in our all-but-entirely digital era, younger generations who didn\u2019t grow up with it won\u2019t have the chance to truly discover it \u2014 no matter who cites Aaliyah as an influence or takes her fashion notes or celebrates the impact she made. As Witt writes, this runs a dangerous risk that Aaliyah will be forgotten. \u201cNostalgia is cyclical,\u201d he adds, and \u201cif Aaliyah's catalog isn't on the right platforms, her music could functionally cease to exist.\u201dhttps://twitter.com/MTVNEWS/status/1362820654630903809Last summer, it seemed like things started moving along, albeit slowly. Aaliyah\u2019s estate gave a statement saying communication had begun regarding the status of her music and its streaming availability. This January, another statement thanked fans for their patience and support: \u201cWe must acknowledge that these matters are not within our control and, unfortunately, take time.\u201dFor those who loved her or still have yet to discover her, hopefully we\u2019re a step closer to having Aaliyah\u2019s music at our fingertips. In the meantime, her voice can still be heard in the musical landscape she helped revolutionize, as well as through the multidimensional trajectory of her legacy \u2014 to be sure, a distinction she wanted all along.\u201cI want people to see me as an entertainer,\u201d Aaliyah considered in a 2001 interview with MTV News. \u201cSomeone who can do it all. I want people to look at me as a full-on entertainer.\u201d She paused, then smiled. \u201cAnd a good person.\u201d ", "author": "MTV News Staff"}, {"date": "2021-03-11T16:14:06Z", "title": "#TBT: How JWOWW Introduced Her Now-Fianc\u00e9 To The Jersey Shore Cast", "full_article": "Jenni \"JWOWW\" Farley \"said yes\" to Zack Carpinello -- and the bride's Jersey Shore family offered their congratulations to the soon-to-be husband and wife.https://www.instagram.com/p/CMNq0lCl6jS/\"So beyond happy for you two!!!!

The Real World: Las Vegas export consistently plays solid games, only to watch them unravel at the 99-yard line.But things seemed to shift on the latest Double Agents episode, and now that Nany\u2019s officially claimed her Gold Skull, is it her luck finally changing, and could Season 36 be hers for the taking?After Devin and Josh were both eliminated as part of a shocking Challenge Security Breach, players began to feel especially hungry for the win\u2026that is, until they were introduced to the next mission, \u201cSurvive the Night.\u201d As part of the game, players \u2014 equipped with very little information \u2014 were chained together, trapped in cages and told they needed to escape.How, exactly? By eating ram testicles, munching on fermented shark and solving a few math equations before breaking out of their cells with small saws.Naturally!Long story short: Most of the game\u2019s players weren\u2019t so down for the buffet\u2026that is, except Kaycee and Leroy, who chewed through the mission like it was cotton candy and racked up their third win as partners.It was a disappointment to Gabby, Nany and Big T, each of whom had yet to earn a Gold Skull. But with her two biggest allies in positions of power, Nany was convinced she\u2019d finally get a shot to win an elimination round, her first since Rivals III.\u201cSeason after season, it\u2019s the same song and dance: I go home right before the final,\u201d Nany said. \u201cFor me, this is everything.\u201dThankfully for Nany and Gabby, things went exactly as planned: Gabby and Cory earned the house\u2019s Crater vote, while Leroy and Kaycee nominated Nany and Kyle. And in \u201cRing of Spies,\u201d Gabby and Nany learned they\u2019d have to be as swift as they were strong to snatch the win.In the best-of-three game, Nany and Gabby had to race to a suspended ring in the middle of the Crater, grab it and return it to a designated home base, plowing through their opponent en route if necessary. And for Gabby, a personal trainer, the game seemed a sure thing, as she carried Nany and the ring all the way to her post to earn her first point.\u201cThere\u2019s this moment where we lock eyes with each other,\u201d Gabby said. \u201cI need to stop playing nice.\u201dBut something shifted after Gabby\u2019s first point: Nany got tough too. Typically one to get frazzled by an early speedbump, Nany, instead, used the misstep as fuel, gritted her teeth and fought.\u201cIn past eliminations, the moment I feel like I\u2019m losing, I become mentally defeated,\u201d Nany said. \u201cThis time, I refuse to let that happen.\u201dAnd after one of the best elimination rounds of the season, and two come-from-behind points, Nany won, earning the final women\u2019s Gold Skull.\u201cWords can\u2019t even describe how I feel right now,\u201d she said as she broke down in tears.Now, Nany, who proceeded to steal Fessy as a partner from Aneesa as part of her prize package, is in a solid spot. So can she keep riding the wave and win The Challenge? Or is it too soon to call, and is there still a chance she might stumble before it\u2019s all over?
